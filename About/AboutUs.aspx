        Look, I didn&#39;t want to be a half-blood. If you&#39;re reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life.

        Being a half-blood is dangerous. It&#39;s scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways. If you&#39;re a normal kid, reading this because you think it&#39;s fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened.

        But if you recognize yourself in these pages—if you feel something stirring inside—stop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it&#39;s only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they&#39;ll come for you. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.</p>
